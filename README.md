## Description
With this homework I was to make a quiz that goes through a series of questions with a timer that counts down and as you get them wrong it subtracts a time amount from it. 

## Issues
After working on this and getting all of the questions entered and tests to be completed I ran into the issue of how to get the information from the terminal into the prebuilt html cards and having the question loop back through depending on the answers selected if more entrees were needed.  

## Tests
node app.js
